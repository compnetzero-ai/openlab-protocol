# Introduction

## What is OpenLab Protocol?

## When should I use this?

When you want to create tools or services that operate in the openlab network.

## How do I use it?

- If you want to run jobs on the network, use the `openlab-cli`
- If you want to make new tools that can participate in the network:
  - use the JS client for node and the browser
  - use the openAPI schema to generate a service
  - use the message schemas to bootstrap your own client
